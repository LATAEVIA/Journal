# _Journal_

#### _An introduction to Node.js, using Npm to install and manage packages, and using Node in a JavaScript application structure., 05/23/2016_

#### By _**LaTaevia**_

## Description

_Web page functioning as a journaling website where a user can write entries including a title and body. Form submission will return the title, body, timestamp, and number of words in the body._

_This exercise serves as practice for using npm and gulp tasks to streamline my development process including: putting the program's functions into their own module(s) using the exports keyword and using separate files for front-end DOM manipulation logic, using gulp tasks to concatenate, minify, browserify, and check code with JSHint, creating a build task, and a clean task, and keeping generated production files in a separate 'build' folder._
